Any of six built-in actions can be triggered when an argument is encountered:
store Save the value, after optionally converting it to a different type. This is the default
action taken if none is specified explicitly.
store_const Save a value defined as part of the argument specification, rather than a value
that comes from the arguments being parsed. This is typically used to implement
command-line flags that are not boolean values.
store_true/store_false Save the appropriate boolean value. These actions are used to
implement Boolean switches.
append Save the value to a list. Multiple values are saved if the argument is repeated.
append_const Save a value defined in the argument specification to a list.
version Print the version details about the program and then exit.
